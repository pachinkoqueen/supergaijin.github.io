			<p>Long ago when I started interviewing users, I fumbled and flailed before discovering Michael Margolis' user research methodology at Google Ventures. His advice quickly whipped my research into shape. The content of this site is based on his work, <a href="https://library.gv.com/@mmargolis">which can be found here.</a> Additionally, remote research gurus Nathan Bolt and Tony Tulathimutte influenced my process. I highly recommend their Rosenfeld book, <a href="https://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/remote-research/">Remote Research: Real Users, Real Time, Real Research.</a></p>

			<p>As part of the UX design and research community I believe in learning from others and building on ideas. It's how we make greatness happen. If you have ideas or VERY STRONG feelings you want shout off the rooftops - or just at me - email me at katherine.kendall at gmail dot com. Also, if anyone does remote facilitated research on mobile devices I want to hear about your set up (#holygrail).</p>
