				<p>At the end of this course, you will have conducted meaningful 30-45 minute conversations with around 8-10 carefully selected users.</p>

			<h2>Interview Users</h2>
				<p>It's time to start chatting with your users!</p>

				<p>Keep everyone engaged with team note taking. On a wall or whiteboard or on a large sheet of paper, label one side "Aha!" and the other side "Observation". During each session, have the team jot their observations and ideas on sticky notes and put them in the appropriate areas. After each session, snap a picture.</p>

				<div class="example">
					<h4><span>Pep Talk</span></h4>
					<p>Feeling nervous before talking to a user is natural but don't sweat it. I like to think about the exceptional interviews I've had in the past with users who excel at articulating their thoughts and craft thoughtful responses at every turn. Remember, starting a cold conversation with a stranger is hard but you've put in all the hard work to prepare.</p>

					<p>IF YOU REALLY WANT TO, you can do a solo session without observers. However nothing guarantees a smashing success of a test like not having anyone there to see it.</p>

					<p>Remember to smile when you talk to users, even if you're not using videoconferencing.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<h3>Between Sessions</h3>
				<p>Once you've ended a session

					<ul>
						<li>Reset your prototype, and clear your browser cache if necessary</li>
						<li>Save the video of the session to your external hard drive</li>
						<li>Grab some water</li>
						<li>Ask observers what they thought and encourage conversation</li>
					</ul>

				<h2>Send Incentives</h2>
				<p>At the end of each day, send out incentives to your users.</p>

				<div class="checklist-button">
					<p id="button-incomplete" class="button-send-incentives"><i class="far fa-circle"></i> Send Incentives: Complete</p>
				</div>

				<h2>Debrief With Team</h2>
				<p>After conducting the last interview of the day, gather the team for a quick rundown. Now is the time to discuss any script updates or prototype changes. Use the sticky notes you gathered during the day's sessions: what were common observations? What surprised them? Get the team thinking.</p>

				<p>If after a full day of testing, one screen or function of your prototype is overwhelmingly confusing to all participants, and there is a clear change the team can agree on, then change it and use the updated prototype for the next day. This is qualitative testing and there is no point in further proving something is unsuccessful.</p>
