		<div class="body-content">
				<p>Your ultimate goal is to have meaningful 30-45 minute conversations with around 8-10 carefully selected users.</p>

			<h2>Share Findings</h2>
				<p>Quickly assemble findings and circulate to the team. Don't spend too long crafting a report or you risk losing momentum.</p>

				<p>What to include
					<ul>
					<li>Research participants</li>
					<li>Key findings</li>
					<li>Screenshots, with highlights of the good and the bad</li>
					<li>List of issues, callouts to critical issues</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<div class="example">
					<h4><span>Example</span></h4>
					<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/11MMNEYTz5RUSyxIwf-5i1fOuAfNx1vJn/view?usp=sharingg">Here is an example of a finished report.</a></p>

					<p>Make a boilerplate and reuse for future reports.</p>
				</div>

				<p>Review the deck with the team and segue into a design session. The team may have already started brainstorming solutions.</p>

				<div class="checklist-button">
					<p id="button-share-findings" class="button-incomplete">Share Findings: Complete</p>
				</div>

				<p>"No one agrees on the findings!"
					Disagreement isn't a bad thing. If given the choice between a team having no response to research (generally an indicator of apathy) and a team arguing about research, I'll always take the latter. If a team argues about results it means they are engaged. Take advantage of momentum to start planning the next round of research: what are the critical questions? Does anyone have a proposed solution? How can we test it?</p>

			<h2>Keep Going</h2>
				<p>You did it! Now there's only one thing to do: keep going. User research is most effective as a regular habit, until it becomes second nature. As you collect feedback and understand user behaviors and habits, you'll find your design conversations migrating away from personal taste and towards observations.</p>

				<p>Capitalize on additional questions the team might have, and immediately schedule the next round of research. Coordinate with metrics, where there are most certainly "why" questions that qualitative research can answer.</p>

				<p>Share the knowledge and cross-train a team member on how to facilitate.</p>

				<div class="checklist-button">
					<p id="button-keep-going" class="button-incomplete">Keep Going: Complete</p>
				</div>

			<h2>Extend Research</h2>
				<p>With each consecutive round of research, you will build a solid body of research that captures user behavior. Leverage this research by creating additional tools.</p>

				<h3>Personas</h3>
				<p>Create evidence-based archetypes of your users. Personas can be used across the organization, from sales and marketing to product to customer support.<br />

				<h3>Mental Models</h3>
				<p>For products that center around complex activities (buying a house, adopting a pet, or planning retirement), mental models help understand and organize user behavior.<br />

				<h3>Journey Maps</h3>
				<p>As you research different parts of your product, you can see how users are moving through your app . Combine research observation with metrics to create a view of how users interact with your product.</p>
