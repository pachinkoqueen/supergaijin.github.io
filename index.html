			<h1>Build better products through qualitative user research</h1>
			<p>No Harvard Business School case study ended with &ldquo;	&hellip; and the company failed because they simply knew too much about their users.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>This site is a hands-on guide to conducting high-quality, remote, facilitated user research. Ultimately, you will have meaningful 30-45 minute conversations with around 8-10 carefully-selected users in the span of one week.</p>

			<h2>High-quality user research is</h2>

			<div class="flex-container indent wtf">
				<div class="fa-4x">

				    <i class="fa-inverse fas fa-comments" data-fa-transform="shrink-6"></i>
				  </span>
				</div>
				<div class="flex-right">
					<h3>Thoughtful</h3>
					<p>Research conducted with precision and rigor results in solid recommendations the entire team can stand behind.</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="flex-container indent">
				<div class="fa-4x">

					<h3>Habitual</h3>
					<p>The goal is not to perform research once, but make it a regular habit whether it's once a sprint, once a week, or twice a month.</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="flex-container indent">

					<h3 class="fa-home">Speedy</h3>
					<p>Late research is like yesterday's news. Luckily, speed comes with time and practice.</p>
				</div>
			</div>


			<h2>What you'll need</h2>
			<p>The materials created throughout this process will become the foundation for future rounds of testing, so you won't have to start from scratch every time.</p>

				<div class="indent">
					<h3>Your team</h3>
					<p>Start with a small core team; as research becomes a regular habit, more team members will join. An open, optimistic attitude towards learning is invaluable.</p>
					
					<h3>Software</h3>
						<p>
							<ul>
							<li>Conferencing app (ex <a href="https://www.gotomeeting.com/">GoTo Meeting</a>)<br />
								Videoconferencing is not necessary. However, you will need a suite allowing users to easily join your meeting, and lets users control your screen.</li>
							<li>Email marketing app (ex <a href="https://mailchimp.com/">MailChimp</a>)<br />
								Recruiting emails are easier to send and track with an email marketing app as opposed to an individual's email address.</li>
							<li>Screening/recruiting tool (<a href="https://ethn.io/">ethn.io</a>)<br />
								ethn.io is a unique product that combines screening, scheduling, and incentive fulfillment. Worth paying for a small plan, just to save the headache of sorting through user responses and manual scheduling. I don't work for ethn.io, I just love their product.</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
					
					<h3>Hardware</h3>
						<p>
							<ul>
							<li>Extra monitor (recommended)</li>
							<li>External hard drive (several gig capacity)</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
					
					<h3>User Incentives</h3>
						<p>Amazon email gift cards are the easiest incentive. For 30 minutes of time, a $20 gift card is enough of an incentive. For 8-10 users, budget $160-$200 per round.</p>
