			<h1>User Research Manifesto</h1>
				<p class="subheading">From this day forward, vow to banish the following bullshit excuses for not performing user research</p>
		</div>

		<div class="body-content">
			<h2>&ldquo;We don't have time&rdquo;</h2>
				<p><strong>Bullshit.</strong> You have time, but you're not making time. Sure, you have to ship product quickly but what's the point if you're rapidly shipping the wrong thing? You could be rapidly shipping a BETTER THING.</p>

				<p>In the past, user research was treated like a BFD, as though research sessions only happen with MANY MANY MANY WEEKS OF PLANNING with a team of OUTSIDE EXPERTS. Plus, we needed a midday cookie presentation! And so we ate cookies and marveled at our test subjects behind the one-way mirror, and a few days later we got back a pretty report that everyone leafed through and shrugged, &ldquo;we knew that already&rdquo; and we went ahead and shipped product.</p>

				<p>But UX research is a backstage activity and a findings report is not the ultimate deliverable; your product is. And that product should demonstrate that you're listening to users. Not just once a year. Not just through an analytics package. </p>

				<p id="quote">At the end of the day you have to know someone before you can help them <br />
			&mdash; Emma Lovewell, Peloton</p>

			<h2>&ldquo;We will test at the end to get validation from users&rdquo;</h2>
				<p><strong>Bullshit.</strong> This translates to &ldquo;we will show this to users but by this point we will have spent so much time and energy on an untested concept we won't really do anything about the results except make a bunch of tickets that will go off to die alone in the JIRA backlog swamp right before we pivot to an internal marketing campaign to camouflage the fact we didn't listen to any users and at the project postmortem we will bitch for an hour then go get Chipotle for lunch.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Sound familiar? Break the cycle.</p>

			<h2>&ldquo;If you talk to 10 different users you will get 10 different opinions&rdquo;</h2>
				<p><strong>Bullshit.</strong> You will uncover 80% of your usability problems with <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-you-only-need-to-test-with-5-users/">just 5 users.</a> There is no need to scale up.

				<p>Even if you're interviewing users to find out how they perform a task outside of your product, clear patterns quickly emerge. Sadly, we are not the unique individuals that we believe ourselves to be.</p>

				<p id="quote">Elaborate usability tests are a waste of resources. The best results come from testing no more than 5 users and running as many small tests as you can afford.<br />
				&mdash; Jakob Nielsen, Nielsen Norman Group</p>

			<h2>&ldquo;Users don't know what they want&rdquo;</h2>
				<p><strong>Of course they fucking don't.</strong> Your users aren't going to design your product; that's your job. 
				Your job is to ask smart questions, and more importantly to listen to the responses. And ask more questions.</p>

				<p>Make no mistake, user research is a skill. Why do you think so many organizations don't bother? Good news is, the barrier to entry is pretty low.  All you need is curiosity, a willingness to learn, and the desire to make research a regular habit.</p>

			<h2>&ldquo;Those are just random opinions; we are a data-driven company&rdquo;</h2>
				<p><strong>Bullshit.</strong> Repeat after me: qualitative research is data. Now keep repeating it to yourself. Then repeat it to your colleagues. Repeat it to upper management.
				Chant it thirteen times in front of a mirror until you conjure an evil spirit and THEN chant it until the evil spirit seriously considers a career change from haunting to user experience research.</p>

				<p>Because it is true. And if you have no faith in your qualitative research, then you either need to improve your process or you need to start <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFodLYztFgY">giving it the respect it deserves.</a> Most likely, both.</p>
		
				<p>Big data is informative, but big data doesn't drive an organization; people do. And without qualitative data to explain the &ldquo;why&rdquo; you run the risk of chasing your tail down a rabbit hole of numbers.</p>

				<p>Start taking qualitative research seriously and quit short-shifting it like a drooling toddler at the Thanksgiving kids' table. User research is a habit, performed at regular intervals. It's not guerrilla testing, any more than engineering is guerrilla engineering. Your research is well-informed, and performed with precision and rigor. And the success of your product depends on it.</p>

				<p>Stop talking to users and start listening to users.
				Practice. Practice. And then practice some more.
				And start now.</p>
